                                    HDFS
                             Assignment 3.3
 
Components of hadoop2.X:
  *Hadoop 2.x is the next version of hadoop1.x which overcomes the drawbacks in hadoop1.x.
  *COMPONENTS:
                    HDFS
                    YARN
                    MapReduce
  *Hadoop Common Module is a Hadoop Base API (A Jar file) for all Hadoop Components. 
    All other components works on top of this module.
  *HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V2 as it is part of Hadoop 2.x with some enhanced features.  
    It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.
  *YARN stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator. It is new Component in Hadoop 2.x Architecture. It is also know as “MR V2”.
  *MapReduce is a Batch Processing or Distributed Data Processing Module. It is also know as “MR V1” as it is part of Hadoop 1.x with some updated features.
  *Remaining all Hadoop Ecosystem components work on top of these three major components: HDFS, YARN ,Map reduce.
  *Each node can act as :  1.Master node  2.Slave node
  *All Master Nodes and Slave Nodes contains both MapReduce and HDFS Components.
  *One Master Node has two components:
              Resource Manager(YARN or MapReduce v2)
              HDFS
  *In Hadoop 2.x, some more Nodes acts as Master Nodes as shown in the above diagram. 
    Each this 2nd level Master Node has 3 components:
             Node Manager
             Application Master
             Data Node

  *Each this 2nd level Master Node again contains one or more Slave Nodes
    These Slave Nodes have two components:
             Node Manager
             HDFS
  *Resource Manager is again divided into two components:
            Scheduler:Responsible to scheduler required resources to Applications 
           Application Manager:Managing assigned Application Life cycle.
 *Node Manager:responsible for Managing the life-cycle of container.
 *Container:Each Master Node or Slave Node contains set of Containers.
                    Container is a portion of Memory in HDFS (Either Name Node or Data Node).
